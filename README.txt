SHORT RANGE TODO:
Adjust sidebar to only examine chosen city
Upon label click, move infowindow to label, and change its contents to shul's info
OSM tiles option

Potential improvements on tfilot:
Search by time range
Search by distance - maps
Accounts â€“ 1) webmaster 2) regional 3) particular minyan

DATABASE WITH LAT/LON:
- Get info: http://tfilot.co.il/shulDetails.php?shulId=5640
- Parse
- For address, get lat/lon (geocoding) on google maps?
